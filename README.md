# M2-Receptor

This repository contains the files and scripts used in the work *M2-Receptor: From the Ground Up* (2025). The folder `A100_OPES` includes the necessary files to replicate the system setup for any Class A GPCR.

If you use any scripts or ideas from this work in your publication, please cite this GitHub repository until the M2 paper is published, as follows:
